Hey Marcus. So here are the changes that I've made since we met on Friday:

  1. Changed getAvgBrightness function so that it returns the median
     brightness of a black spot instead of the mean (I have also renamed
     the function to "getMedianBrightness").
  2. Implemented a variation of topOfBallBrighterThanBottomMean, called
     "topofBallBrighterThanBottomMedian," which, as its name suggests,
     compares the medians of the brightnesses of the pixels in the top
     and bottom halves of the ball instead of the means.

I believe I mentioned that it would probably be a good idea to call the
"topOfBall..." functions only on the best ball found. Currently, I think
the code is checking all white spots that pass the filter. Fixing this
should just be matter of changing a couple of lines. Anyway, that would
be something to do. I also think we should get more logs and start
collecting data. Do you know MATLAB by chance? Or Excel? Or some other
software that would let us graph stuff?
